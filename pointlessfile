# About This Page
 **Use the suggested recommendations to highly POTENTIAL optimizations, and test well before shipping to any production environments.  Always make sure you use filters to narrow down the set of data so that the recommendations are sensible.  For example filter by such attributes as cluster, deployment, and namesspace.**

  ## How to Use These Recommendations

  There are several specific variables in your K8s configurations that can be adjusted based on what you see in this report.
  
 * [Requests & Limits](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits)
  * [Memory](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory)
  * [CPU](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-cpu)
   * [ResourceQuota](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)
  * [LimitRange](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/)
  
 **The mechanics behind k8s resources are explained here:** https://blog.kubecost.com/blog/requests-and-limits/

 ## Acknowledgement

At Futurestack 2022 we showed how to use this data to potentially optimize both memory and CPU configures. Please utilize the dashboard filtering capabilities to filter to a specfic cluster, namespace, or container.

## Over-Utilization Indicators

In some environments we may be over-utilizing key resources.  In those scenarios optimization is contra-indicated.

CPU Thottling and OOM Kills are good indicators of potential overutilization of CPU and Memory resources.
